# DeathsofDespair
Deaths Due to Suicide, Drug Poisoning, or Alcohol-Specific Causes in English Coastal Areas (2011–2018)

# Project Overview
Analysis of mortality trends related to suicide, drug poisoning, and alcohol-specific deaths across English coastal regions, examining gender disparities, geographical patterns, and temporal trends.

 ## "How do patterns of deaths of despair (suicide, drug poisoning, and alcohol-specific deaths) vary across gender, age groups, and geographical classifications in English coastal areas from 2011-2018?"

 
Key Visualizations and Insights:
1. Death Rates Over Time by Gender (2011–2018):

- The line charts display trends in average death rates for females and 
  males across three causes of death: suicide, drug poisoning, and alcohol- 
  specific deaths.
  
- Males exhibit consistently higher death rates across all categories 
  compared to females, with noticeable increases in alcohol-specific deaths 
  over the years.

2. Mortality Rates by Age Group and Gender (2018):

- This stacked bar chart highlights how mortality rates vary by age and 
  gender for the three causes of death.
  
- Middle-aged groups (25–44 and 45–64) show the highest death rates, 
  particularly for males.
  
- Suicide and drug poisoning are prominent in younger age groups, while 
  alcohol-specific deaths become more significant with older age.
  
3. Treemap of Death Rates by Coastal Classification:

- The treemap visualizes the distribution of deaths based on geographical 
  classification (coastal vs. non-coastal) and cause of death.
  
 - Alcohol-specific deaths dominate across all geographical areas, followed 
   by suicide and drug poisoning.
   
- Non-coastal towns contribute to a larger share of total deaths compared to 
  coastal towns, but coastal towns still display significant numbers.

4.Average Mortality Rates by Coastal and Non-Coastal Towns:

 - This bar chart compares the average mortality rates for coastal and non- 
   coastal towns, with dashed lines representing upper (UCL) and lower (LCL) 
   control limits.
   
   - Coastal towns have slightly higher average mortality rates compared to 
    non-coastal towns, suggesting potential localized challenges in coastal 
    areas.

## How the Visualizations Address the Research Question:
- Gender Differences:
The line charts and bar charts show stark gender disparities, with males being disproportionately affected across all categories and years.

-Age Group Variations:
Mortality trends by age illustrate that middle-aged and older individuals are particularly vulnerable to deaths of despair, highlighting critical periods for intervention.

-Geographical Patterns:
Both the treemap and bar charts confirm that coastal areas face unique challenges in addressing deaths of despair, though non-coastal areas generally show higher absolute numbers.

These insights can inform policymakers, healthcare professionals, and community planners about where to focus resources and interventions for maximum impact.
